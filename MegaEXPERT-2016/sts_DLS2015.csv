As a matter of urgency, therefore, the staff complement of the Interdepartmental Group attached to the Commission Secretariat should be strengthened at the earliest possible opportunity in order to ensure that all proposals for acts which are general in scope are accompanied, when considered by the College of Commissioners and on the basis of Article 299(2), by a simplified sheet outlining their potential impact.	0.898053658597	0.791963018158

Thank you very much, Commissioner.	0.865618839281	0.714991712611

This rule can be applied equally to all recreational but dangerous drugs when no one but the person consuming the drug is likely to be affected.	0.840250609667	0.795336682199

We have heard that the previous Council Presidency first restructured and then scrapped the Ministry for Equality.	0.628766906482	0.454579081374

Above all, when a one-man company or a company with fewer than 250 employees has a project, it should not need to provide 120% loan guarantees in the form of land to receive financing; it should also be possible for it to be funded on the basis of a good idea.	0.959009533838	0.879725252407

While withdrawing the resolution, however, I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if, in anticipation of the Council of Nice, it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda.	0.978172728093	0.962697496234
